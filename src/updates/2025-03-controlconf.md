# Luthien at ControlConf London

We're excited to announce that Luthien will be attending **ControlConf** in London on **March 27-28, 2025**.

ControlConf brings together researchers, engineers, and organizations working on AI safety and control technologies. This will be a great opportunity to connect with the community and share our progress on production-ready AI Control systems.

Our team will be presenting our latest research and implementation strategies for practical AI control mechanisms. We look forward to engaging discussions and collaborations with others in the field.

If you're planning to attend, we'd love to meet you there! Reach out to us at [{{ site.contactEmail }}](mailto:{{ site.contactEmail }}) to schedule a meeting.
