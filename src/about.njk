        Luthien is developing AI Control, as proposed in 
        <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06942" target="_blank" class="inline-link">
        "AI Control: Improving Safety Despite Intentional Subversion"</a> (2023),
        into a production-ready solution that can be deployed in real-world AI systems.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Based in Seattle, Luthien is the only AI Safety organization headquartered in the Pacific Northwest.
        Our secondary mission is to establish a robust AI Safety presence in Seattle, creating a community
        of researchers and engineers dedicated to ensuring AI systems remain safe and aligned with human values.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Luthien was founded by Jai Dhyani, a former Meta ML Software Engineer, MATS alumnus, and co-author on 
        METR's <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15114" target="_blank" class="inline-link">
        "RE-Bench: Evaluating frontier AI R&D capabilities of language model agents against human experts"</a> (2024).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Currently operating as a minimal organization, Luthien is looking to grow quickly. We exist thanks to
        generous small donors and a seed grant from the AI Safety Tactical Opportunities Fund. Your donations 
        will directly accelerate the development of practical AI Control solutions.
