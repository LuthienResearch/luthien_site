                Luthien is dedicated to making artificial intelligence safe, reliable, and aligned with human values. 
                As AI systems become increasingly powerful and embedded in critical infrastructure, our mission is to 
                develop robust control mechanisms that ensure these systems operate within safe parameters.

            <p>
                Our team brings together expertise in AI safety research, systems engineering, and ethical AI deployment. 
                We believe that controlling powerful AI systems requires a multidisciplinary approach that combines 
                technical safeguards with appropriate governance structures.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                We are committed to open collaboration with research institutions, industry partners, and policymakers 
                to develop production-ready AI control systems that can be deployed in real-world applications.
